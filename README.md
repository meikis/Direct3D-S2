## 📝 Abstract

Generating high-resolution 3D shapes using volumetric representations such as Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) presents substantial computational and memory challenges. We introduce <strong class="has-text-weight-bold">Direct3D‑S2</strong>, a scalable 3D generation framework based on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the <strong class="has-text-weight-bold">Spatial Sparse Attention (SSA)</strong> mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively process large token sets within sparse volumes, substantially reducing computational overhead and achieving a <em>3.9&times;</em> speedup in the forward pass and a <em>9.6&times;</em> speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational autoencoder (VAE) that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input, latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets, and experiments demonstrate that <strong class="has-text-weight-bold">Direct3D‑S2</strong> not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables <strong class="has-text-weight-bold">training at 1024<sup>3</sup>  resolution with just 8 GPUs</strong>, a task typically requiring at least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256<sup>3</sup> resolution, thus making gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible.

## 🌟 Highlight

- **Gigascale 3D Generation**: Direct3D-S2 enables training at 1024<sup>3</sup> resolution with only 8 GPUs.
- **Spatial Sparse Attention (SSA)**: A novel attention mechanism designed for sparse volumetric data, enabling efficient processing of large token sets.
- **Unified Sparse VAE**: A variational autoencoder that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input, latent, and output stages, improving training efficiency and stability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

### ✅ Tested Environment

> 💡 *If you're setting up on Windows, check out [issue #11](https://github.com/DreamTechAI/Direct3D-S2/issues/11) and [issue #12](https://github.com/DreamTechAI/Direct3D-S2/issues/12). Big thanks to the contributors who helped get Direct3D-S2 working on Windows!*

- **System**: Ubuntu 22.04  
- **CUDA Toolkit**: [CUDA 12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)  
- **PyTorch**: Install `torch` and `torchvision` first.  
  Make sure the PyTorch CUDA version matches your installed CUDA Toolkit.

  ```bash
  pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
  ```
- **Torchsparse**:
  follow the [offical guide](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchsparse) or:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchsparse
  cd torchsparse && python -m pip install .
  ```

- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DreamTechAI/Direct3D-S2.git
  
  cd Direct3D-S2
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  pip install -e .
  
  ```

### Usage

> Note: Generating at 512 resolution requires at least 10GB of VRAM, and 1024 resolution needs around 24GB. We don’t recommend generating models at 512 resolution, as it’s just an intermediate step of the 1024 model and the quality is noticeably lower.

```python
from direct3d_s2.pipeline import Direct3DS2Pipeline
pipeline = Direct3DS2Pipeline.from_pretrained(
  'wushuang98/Direct3D-S2', 
  subfolder="direct3d-s2-v-1-1"
)
pipeline.to("cuda:0")

mesh = pipeline(
  'assets/test/13.png', 
  sdf_resolution=1024, # 512 or 1024
  remove_interior=True,
  remesh=False, # Switch to True if you need to reduce the number of triangles.
)["mesh"]

mesh.export('output.obj')
```

### Web Demo

We provide a Gradio web demo for Direct3D-S2, which allows you to generate 3D meshes from images interactively.

```bash
python app.py
```
